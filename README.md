# ChatroomApp
ðŸ¥´A web chatroom app

This is a chatroom application that could either run on localhost or be deployed on a remote server with 5050 port open for TCP. person.py and server.py should be running on the server side. client.py and app.py should be running on the client side. After deploying the server and configuring the ip addr and port on client.py, you can enter the chatroom GUI using a terminal by entering python3 app.py. The executable file now connected to my server.

You can test the connection between server and client using test.py which automatically send message to the server using two person.py objects(Tim and Phil).
